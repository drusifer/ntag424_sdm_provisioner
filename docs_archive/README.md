# Archived Documentation

This directory contains historical investigation documents and session summaries that are no longer relevant to the current working implementation.

## Contents

These documents were created during the development and debugging process but have been superseded by:
- **MINDMAP.md** - Current project status
- **charts.md** - Verified sequence diagrams
- **ARCH.md** - Production architecture
- **SUCCESSFUL_PROVISION_FLOW.md** - Proven working trace

## Why Archived

These documents contain:
- Investigations of issues that have been resolved
- Failed hypotheses and approaches
- Intermediate refactoring states
- Historical session notes
- Obsolete API documentation

They are preserved for historical reference but should not be used for current development.
