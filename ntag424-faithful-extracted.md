General description
1.1
Introduction
NTAG 424 DNA (NT4H2421Gx) sets a new standard in secure NFC and IoT
applications, introducing a new NTAG DNA chip generation with state-of-the-art features
for security and privacy protection. It comes with AES-128 cryptographic operation
and a new Secure Unique NFC (SUN) Message feature to generate tap-unique data
authentication upon each read-out by an NFC enabled mobile device. This enables
most advanced product and content protection, plus secured exclusive user experiences
served in real time.
NTAG 424 DNA is fully compliant with the NFC Forum Type 4 Tag IC specification
(Certification ID: 58562), with the contactless proximity protocol according to ISO/
IEC14443-4 and the ISO/IEC 7816-4 based file system and command frames, to ensure
maximum interoperability within the NFC infrastructure. Its NFC performance supports
superior user interaction and reading distances of up to 10 cm.
Using AES-128 cryptography, the tag generates a Secure Unique NFC (SUN) message
for the authentication each time it is being tapped. An NFC mobile device reads this
tap-unique URL with the SUN authentication message, sends it to the host where tag
and message authentication take place, and returns the verification result. The SUN
authentication mechanism is guaranteed to work on Android (without a dedicated app)
and iOS11 (with an app). This way, NTAG 424 DNA offers tag authentication, as well as
data assurances on authenticity, integrity and even confidentiality, while also securing
physical tag presence, see also Section 9.3.
The chip has a file-based memory structure of totally 416 bytes (compliant to NFC
Forum Type 4 Tag and ISO/IEC 7816-4) with a Capability Container (CC) file to specify
the NFC Forum tag operation, an NDEF file as well as an extra data file to protect
sensitive content. Configurable access rights per file support different use cases of brand
product manufacturers and service providers to meet specific security and operational
requirements. With 5 customer defined AES keys, NTAG 424 DNA enables advanced
cryptographic functionalities – for the CMAC, optionally combined with encrypted data,
for SUN, mutual authentication (secure host or reader authentication) and for secure
access to the NDEF file and the extra data file.
NTAG 424 DNA contains configurable features like optionally encrypting part of the
NDEF file, and the fully encrypted communication mode to address privacy sensitive
applications. The optional Random ID together with the encrypted chip UID/data that
can be mirrored in the NDEF file, enables compliance with latest user data protection
regulations.
Besides the standard AES-128 implementation, NTAG 424 DNA can also offer an
alternative AES-based protocol for authentication and secure messaging using a

Leakage Resilient Primitive, or LRP – a wrapper around the AES cryptography to
enhance side-channel attack resistance.
Thanks to its high input capacitance of 50 pF, NTAG 424 DNA tag IC is well suited for
smart product applications requiring smaller footprint antennas, without compromise
on performance. Smaller NFC tags can more easily be embedded in product labels,
modules, caps and closures, and other packaging formats.

Functional description
8.1
Interface initialization and protocol
NT4H2421Gx is fully compliant to ISO/IEC 14443-2 [1] radio frequency power and signal
interface, the initialization and anti-collision is according to ISO/IEC 14443-3 [2] and it
uses transmission protocol as specified in ISO/IEC 14443-4 [3] of PICC Type A.
8.1.1
ISO/IEC 14443 parameter values
This section describes the values for ISO/IEC 14443 activation and selection. Usage of
Random ID can be changed using the SetConfiguration command.
Note, that any change in the ISO/IEC 14443 parameter values through SetConfiguration
requires a power cycle to make those changes effective.
ATQA
ATQA value is 0344h, which denotes double size (7-byte) UID. However, NT4H2421Gx
offers configuration of Random ID which is single size (4-byte). If the Random ID feature
is enabled, then the ATQA is changed to 0304h. According to ISO/IEC 14443-3, the
ATQA bytes are transmitted as LSB first.
SAK
For double size UID, the value of SAK1 in cascade level 1 is 04h, indicating that the UID
is not complete. SAK2 in cascade level 2 is 20h, indicating UID complete and supporting
ISO/IEC 14443-4. For single size UID which is used in the Random ID case, the value of
SAK is 20h, indicating UID complete and supporting ISO/IEC 14443-4.
UID
The ISO/IEC 14443-3 compliant UID is programmed and locked during production. The
first byte of the double size UID is fixed to 04h, indicating NXP as manufacturer.

8.2.3.1
StandardData file
A StandardData file stores the data as raw data bytes. Data is accessed by chunk of byte
at a certain offset in the StandardData file and with a certain byte length.
A StandardData file can be read with the ReadData and ISOReadBinary commands.
The data can be written with the WriteData and ISOUpdateBinary commands.
ISOReadBinary and ISOUpdateBinary are standard ISO/IEC 7816-4 interindustry
commands, see [4].
A StandardData file is not covered by the transaction mechanism and therefore does
not implement a transaction-based backup mechanism. Thus data are available to read
as soon as they are written in the file. The writing operations of single frames up to 128
bytes with a WriteData or ISOUpdateBinary command are also tearing protected.
NT4H2421Gx is configured to hold the NDEF message in StandardData file No 02h, see
Section 8.2.3. Enabling SDM is only possible for this file. At delivery, SDM is disabled.
8.2.3.2
Capability Container File
The Capability Container (CC) file is a StandardData file with respect to access rights
management and data management. This file will hold the CC-file according to [15]. At
delivery it will hold following content:
• CCLEN = 0017h, i.e. 23 bytes
• T4T_VNo = 20h, i.e. Mapping Version 2.0
• MLe = 0100h, i.e. 256 bytes
• MLc = 00FFh, i.e. 255 bytes
• NDEF-File_Ctrl_TLV
– T = 04h, indicates the NDEF-File_Ctrl_TLV
– L = 06h, i.e. 6 bytes
– NDEF-File File Identifier = E104h
– NDEF-File File Size = 0100h, i.e. 256 bytes
– NDEF-File READ Access Condition = 00h, i.e. READ access granted without any
security

File access rights management
File data is accessed with 3 different access rights Read, Write and ReadWrite.
In addition, an access right called Change is specified per file permitting
ChangeFileSettings to change the file access rights.
An access right is granted if at least one condition associated to it is satisfied. Such
conditions are called access conditions. Access conditions are associated with an access
right and evaluated to decide whether the access right is granted or not. There are three
kinds of access conditions:
• The access condition where a valid authentication with a given AppKey of the targeted
application is needed to access related commands listed in Table 9. The access
condition is satisfied if the current valid authentication has been performed with the
given AppKey and not satisfied in all other cases. The AppKey is specified with its
number.
• The free access condition meaning the related commands listed in Table 9 can be
accessed without an active authentication.
• The no access condition meaning no access to related commands listed in Table 9.
The access conditions are specified on 4 bits as defined in the following table.

A command listed in Table 9 is accepted if at least one access condition associated with
an access right granting access to it is satisfied. If authenticated and the only access
conditions satisfied are the free access Eh ones, then the CommMode.Plain is to be
applied.
If not authenticated, Secure Dynamic Messaging will be applied if access is granted
via SDMFileRead, even if there is free access via one of the other access rights.
SDMFileRead is not affecting the regular secure messaging, i.e. if authenticated.
8.2.3.4
SDM related access rights
A StandardData file can be associated with the following Secure Dynamic Messaging
access rights: SDMMetaRead, SDMFileRead and SDMCtrRet. SDMCtrRet is
interpreted as the access rights defined according to Table 6 and grants access to the
GetFileCounters command. The others have a different interpretation.
The SDMMetaRead access does not define access to certain commands, but it defines
the mirroring of PICCData, i.e. whether the PICCData will be mirrored in plain, encrypted
or not at all, see also Section 9.3.3. This is interpreted according to Table 10.
Note that it is still possible to enable plain PICCData mirroring of the UID even if Random
ID is enabled. For privacy protection, it is strongly recommended to use only encrypted
PICCData mirroring for the UID if Random ID is enabled.

possible to freely read the file if Read or ReadWrite access right are set to Eh. In this
case, plain mirroring of the PICCData, see Section 9.3.3, is still applied if the card is
configured for that.

Communication modes
NT4H2421Gx supports three communication modes as defined in Table 12. As shown
in the table, the different communication modes can be represented by two bits. This
representation is used at several places in the document.

The communication mode defines the level of security for the communication between
PCD and PICC after mutual authentication. At application level, the communication
mode is defined by the command itself, as specified in Table 22. The specified
communication mode is applied if there is an active authentication regardless of whether
this authentication is required by the command or not.
At file level, the communication mode is defined by the file. The specified communication
mode is applied if there is an active authentication. Note, if the only valid access
condition for a certain access right is free access (Eh) under an active authentication,
CommMode.Plain has to be applied, see also Section 8.2.3.3.

8.3
Native Command Format
NT4H2421Gx always communicates in ISO/IEC 7816-4 wrapped mode as described
in Section 8.4. Nevertheless it is important to understand the basic format of native
commands which consist of the following parts.
A command as sent by the PCD consists of the concatenation of:
• the command code (Cmd)
• zero, one or more header fields (CmdHeader)
• zero, one or more data fields (CmdData)
The response as sent by the PICC consists of the concatenation of:
• the return code (RC)
• zero, one or more data fields (RespData)
NT4H2421Gx supports the APDU message structure according to ISO/IEC 7816-4 [4]
for:
• wrapping of the native command format into a proprietary ISO/IEC 7816-4 APDU
• a subset of the standard ISO/IEC 7816-4 commands (ISOSelectFile, ISOReadBinary,
ISOUpdateBinary)
Remark: Communication via native ISO/IEC7816-4 commands without wrapping is not
supported.
On the native command interface, plain command parameters consisting of multiple
bytes are represented least significant byte (LSB) first, similar as for ISO/IEC 14443
parameters during the activation, see [2]. For cryptographical parameters and keys
(including the random numbers exchanged during authentication, the TI and the
computed MACs), this does not hold. For these, the representation on the interface maps
one-to-one to the most significant byte (MSB) first notation used in this specification.
Note that within this document, the ’Xh’ prefix indicates hexadecimal integer notation, i.e.
not reflecting the byte order representation on the command interface at all.
8.4
ISO/IEC7816-4 Communication frame
NT4H2421Gx uses ISO/IEC 7816-4 [4] type APDUs for command-response pair for both,
wrapping of native commands as outlined in Section 8.3 and standard ISO/IEC 7816-4
commands.
Note that for all parameters of standard ISO/IEC 7816-4 commands, the representation
on the interface is most significant byte (MSB) first notation. As data like the 2-byte ISO/
IEC 7816-4 file identifiers, are in different order for the wrapped native commands, this
needs to be taken into account.

cases:

• the PICC supports ISO/IEC 14443-4 chaining to allow larger command or response
frames than the supported buffer size for variants of the following commands:
– Native commands wrapped into ISO/IEC 7816-4 APDU: ReadData, WriteData, see
Section 10.
– Standard ISO/IEC 7816-4 commands: ISOReadBinary, ISOUpdateBinary
i.e. every command where larger frame size can occur.
• the PICC will automatically split a response in several frames to fit with the FSD frame
size supported by the PCD and communicated in the RATS.
When a PCD applies ISO/IEC 14443-4 chaining, see [3], it needs to assure the
reassembled INF field containing the command header (i.e. ISO/IEC 7816-4 header
bytes and/or (Cmd || CmdHeader)) fits within the PICC’s buffer (FSC) communicated in
the ATS. If not, the PICC may respond with LENGTH_ERROR.
The ISO/IEC 14443-4 chaining does not influence the secure messaging. This means
that the secure messaging mechanisms are applied as if the command or response
would have been sent in a single large frame. With regards to command execution,
commands are handled as if they were received in one large frame, except for write
commands where the total frame size can be larger than the supported FSC (WriteData
and ISOUpdateBinary). In this case, command execution is started before the complete
command is received.
Note that this is important for StandardData files, where the file may end up in an
undefined state if the command is not completed successfully, see Section 8.6.

Secure Messaging
Prior to data transmission a mutual three-pass authentication can be done between PICC
and PCD which results in the generation of session keys used in the secure messaging.
There are three secure messaging types available in the NT4H2421Gx including Secure
Dynamic Messaging. One is using AES-128 and is referred to as AES mode in this data
sheet. The other one is using AES-128 with a Leakage Resilient Primitive (LRP) wrapper,
also referred to as LRP mode. The LRP mode can be permanently enabled using the
SetConfiguration command. After this switch, it is not possible to revert back to AES
mode.
Compared to AES mode, the LRP mode has the advantage that it provides strong
resistance against side-channel and fault attacks. It serves as a replacement for
AES as it only uses standard cryptographic constructions based on AES without any
proprietary cryptography. Thus, LRP can be seen as an alternative for AES which is
itself based on AES, and is provably as secure as AES, but comes with better properties
w.r.t. implementation security, see also [10]. The PCD requires the same LRP mode
implementation.
To improve the resistance against side-channel attacks and especially card only attacks
for the AES mode, NT4H2421Gx provides a limit for unsuccessful authentication
attempts. Every unsuccessful authentication is counted in the TotFailCtr. The parameters
TotFailCtrLimit TotFailCtrDecr can be configured as described in Section 10.5.1 using the
"Failed authentication counter configuration".
Each unsuccessful authentication is counted internally in the total failed authentication
counter TotFailCtr. After reaching the TotFailCtrLimit, see Section 10.5.1, the related key
cannot be used for authentication anymore.
In addition, after reaching a limit of consecutive unsuccessful authentication
attempts, the NT4H2421Gx starts to slow down the authentication processing in
order to hamper attacks. This is done by rejecting any authentication command
with a AUTHENTICATION_DELAY response. The response time of a single
AUTHENTICATION_DELAY response is depending on the FWT, see Section 8.1.1, and
is about 65% of the maximum response time specified by FWT. The error response is
sent until the total authentication delay time is reached which is equal to the sum of the
frame delay times. The total authentication delay time increases with each unsuccessful
authentication attempt up to a maximum value, only a successful authentication restores
the full operational speed.
Changing a blocked AES key by authenticating with the AppMasterKey and using the
ChangeKey command makes the referenced key accessible again. If the AppMasterKey
itself is blocked, no recovery is possible.
Each successful AES authentication decrements the TotFailCtr by a value of
TotFailCtrDecr.
The AES and LRP authentications are initiated by commands sharing the same
command code (First Authentication and Non-First Authentication variants). These
authentication protocols are both AES-based, but differ with regards to the actual
protocol applied and the subsequent secure messaging mode they initiate. An overview
of the different modes is given in Figure 5.

A First Authentication can be executed at any time whether the PICC is in authenticated

The Non-First Authentication can only be executed while the card is in authenticated
state after a successful First or Non-First Authentication.
Correct application of First Authentication and Non-First Authentication allows to
cryptographically bind all messages within a transaction together by the transaction
identifier established in a First Authentication, see Section 9.1.1, and a command
counter, see Section 9.1.2, even if multiple authentications are required.

The AuthenticateEV2First initiates a standard AES authentication and secure messaging,

The negotiation between those two variants is done using the capabilities of the First
Authentication and the return message of the first part, where a PCD can distinguish
between standard AES authentication and LRP authentication based on the message
length.

On First Authentication, the PCD can choose between AES and LRP secure messaging
by setting bit 1 of PCDCap2.1 in the issued command. The PD is configured for either
AES or LRP secure messaging by the setting of bit 1 from PDCap2.1. This setting is
defined with SetConfiguration, see Section 10.5.1.
If the PCD chooses for AES secure messaging, it sends PCDCap2.1 equaling 00h (or
no PCDCap2 at all). A NT4H2421Gx will accept the authentication if its PDCap2.1 bit 1
is not set, i.e. the NT4H2421Gx is configured for AES secure messaging. The command
is interpreted as AuthenticateEV2First, see Section 9.1.5 for detailed specification. If
PDCap2.1 bit 1 is set, i.e. the NT4H2421Gx is configured for LRP secure messaging, the
authentication request is rejected.
If the PCD chooses for LRP secure messaging, it sends PCDCap2.1 equaling 02h.
NTAG 424 DNA will accept the authentication if its PDCap2.1 bit 1 is set, i.e. the
NT4H2421Gx is configured for LRP secure messaging. The command is interpreted as
AuthenticateLRPFirst and replied with 18 bytes, i.e. ADDITIONAL_FRAME, followed
by an additional AuthMode indicating LRP secure messaging, and 16 bytes of data,
see Section 10.4.3 for detailed specification. If PDCap2.1 bit 1 is not set, i.e. the
NT4H2421Gx is configured for AES secure messaging, the authentication request is
also accepted, but responded with 17 bytes, i.e. the AuthenticateEV2First response
composed of ADDITIONAL_FRAME, followed by 16 bytes of data, allowing the PCD to
fall back to standard AES authentication as well.
With Non-First Authentication, the PCD cannot choose between standard AES and
LRP. If authenticated using AES mode, AuthenticateEV2NonFirst will be applied, see
Section 9.1.6. If authenticated with LRP mode, AuthenticateLRPNonFirst will be applied,
see Section 10.4.4. If not authenticated at all, e.g. if targeting one of the originality keys,
only AuthenticateLRPNonFirst is supported.

9.1
AES Secure Messaging
The AES Secure Messaging is managed by AuthenticateEV2First and
AuthenticateEV2NonFirst.
Note that AuthenticateEV2First and AuthenticateEV2NonFirst can also be used to start
LRP Secure Messaging, as defined in Section 9.2. This is done with the PCDCap2 sent
in First Authentication and the return code, see Section 9 and Section 9.2.5 for details.
9.1.1
Transaction Identifier
In order to avoid interleaving of transactions from multiple PCDs toward one PICC, the
Transaction Identifier (TI) is included in each MAC that is calculated over commands
or responses. The TI is generated by the PICC and communicated to the PCD with a
successful execution of an AuthenticateEV2First command, see Section 10.4.1. The size
is 4 bytes and these 4 bytes can hold any value. The TI is treated as a byte array, so
there is no notion of MSB and LSB.
9.1.2
Command Counter
A command counter is included in the MAC calculation for commands and responses in
order to prevent e.g. replay attacks. It is also used to construct the Initialization Vector
(IV) for encryption and decryption.
Each command, besides few exceptions, see below, is counted by the command counter
CmdCtr which is a 16-bit unsigned integer. Both sides count commands, so the actual
value of the CmdCtr is never transmitted. The CmdCtr is reset to 0000h at PCD and
PICC after a successful AuthenticateEV2First authentication and it is maintained as
long as the PICC remains authenticated. In cryptographic calculations, the CmdCtr is
represented LSB first. Subsequent authentications using AuthenticateEV2NonFirst do not
affect the CmdCtr. Subsequent authentications using the AuthenticateEV2First will reset
the CmdCtr to 0000h. The CmdCtr is increased between the command and response, for
all communication modes.
When a MAC on a command is calculated at PCD side that includes the CmdCtr, it uses
the current CmdCtr. The CmdCtr is afterwards incremented by 1. At PICC side, a MAC
appended at received commands is checked using the current value of CmdCtr. If the
MAC matches, CmdCtr is incremented by 1 after successful reception of the command,
and before sending a response.
For CommMode.Full, the same holds for both the MAC and encryption IV calculation, i.e.
the non-increased value is used for the command calculations while the increased value
is used for the response calculations.
If the CmdCtr holds the value FFFFh and a command maintaining the active
authentication arrives at the PICC, this leads to an error response and the command is
handled like the MAC was wrong.
Command chaining, see Section 8.5, does not affect the counter. The chained command
is considered as a single command, just as for the other aspects of secure messaging,
and thus the related counter is increased only once.
9.1.3
MAC Calculation
MACs are calculated using the underlying block cipher according to the CMAC standard
described in [6]. Padding is applied according to the standard.

The MAC used in NT4H2421Gx is truncated by using only the 8 even-numbered bytes
out of the 16 bytes output as described [6] when represented in most-to-least-significant
order.
Initialization Vector for MACing
The initialization vector used for the CMAC computation is the zero byte IV as prescribed
[6].
9.1.4
Encryption
Encryption and decryption are calculated using AES-128 according to the CBC mode of
NIST SP800-38A [5].
Padding is applied according to Padding Method 2 of ISO/IEC 9797-1 [7], i.e. by adding
always 80h followed, if required, by zero bytes until a string with a length of a multiple
of 16 byte is obtained. Note that if the plain data is a multiple of 16 bytes already, an
additional padding block is added. The only exception is during the authentication itself
(AuthenticateEV2First and AuthenticateEV2NonFirst), where no padding is applied at all.
The notation E(key, message) is used to denote the encryption and D(key, message) for
decryption.
Initialization Vector for Encryption
When encryption is applied to the data sent between the PCD and the PICC, the
Initialization Vector (IV) is constructed by encrypting with SesAuthENCKey according to
the ECB mode of NIST SP800-38A [5] the concatenation of:
• a 2-byte label, distinguishing the purpose of the IV: A55Ah for commands and 5AA5h
for responses
• Transaction Identifier TI
• Command Counter CmdCtr (LSB first)
• Padding of zeros acc. to NIST SP800-38B [6]
This results in the following IVs:
IV for CmdData = E(SesAuthENCKey; A5h || 5Ah || TI || CmdCtr || 0000000000000000h)
IV for RespData = E(SesAuthENCKey;5Ah || A5h || TI || CmdCtr || 0000000000000000h)
When an encryption or decryption is calculated, the CmdCtr to be used in the IV are
the current values. Note that this means that if CmdCtr = n before the reception of a
command, after the validation of the command CmdCtr = n + 1 and that value will be
used in the IV for the encryption of the response.
For the encryption during authentication (both AuthenticateEV2First and
AuthenticateEV2NonFirst), the IV will be 128 bits of 0.
9.1.5
AuthenticateEV2First Command
This section defines the Authentication, which is mandatory to be used first in a
transaction when using Secure Messaging, see Table 18. In this procedure both, the
PICC as well as the PCD show in an encrypted way that they possess the same secret,
i.e. the same key. This authentication is supported with AES keys.
The authentication consists of two parts: AuthenticateEV2First - Part1 and Section 9.1.6
- Part2. Detailed command definition can be found in Section 10.4.1. The protocol cannot

be interrupted by other commands. On any command different from AuthenticateEV2First
- Part2 received after the successful execution of the first part, the PICC aborts the
ongoing authentication.
During this authentication phase, the PICC accepts messages from the PCD that are
longer than the lengths derived from this specification as long as LenCap is correct. This
feature is to support the upgradability to following generations of NT4H2421Gx. The
PCD rejects answers from the PICC when they don’t have the proper length. Note that if
present, PCDcap2:1:Bit1 must not be set, otherwise LRP authentication is targeted, see
Section 9.2.5.
Upon reception of AuthenticateEV2First, the PICC validates the targeted key. If the key
does not exist, AuthenticateEV2First is rejected.
The PICC generates a random 16-byte challenge RndB and send this encrypted to
the PCD, according to Section 9.1.4. Additionally, the PICC resets CmdCtr to zero and
generate a random Transaction Identifier (TI).
Upon reception of the AuthenticateEV2First response from the PICC, the PCD also
generates a random 16-byte challenge RndA. The PCD encrypts, on his turn, the
concatenation of RndA with RndB', which is the received challenge after decryption
and rotating it left by one byte. Within AuthenticateEV2First - Part2, this is sent to the
PICC. Upon reception of AuthenticateEV2First - Part2, the PICC decrypts the second
message and validates the received RndB'. If not as expected, the command is rejected.
Else it generates RndA' by rotating left the received RndA by one byte. This is returned
together with the generated TI. Also, the PICC sends 12 bytes of capabilities to the PCD:
6 bytes of PICC capabilities PDcap2 and 6 bytes of PCD capabilities PCDcap2 that were
received on the command (sent back for verification).
The use of those capabilities, and the negotiation process is described in Section 9. Note
that part of PDCap will be configurable with SetConfiguration. PCDcap2 is used to refer
both to the value sent from the PCD to the PICC and to the value used in the encrypted
response message from the PICC to the PCD where in this case the PCDcap2 is the
adjusted version of the originally sent PCDcap2: i.e. truncated or padded with zero bytes
to a length of 6 bytes if needed.
On successful execution of the authentication protocol, the session keys
SesAuthMACKey and SesAuthENCKey are generated according to Section 9.1.7. The
PICC is in EV2 authenticated state and the Secure Messaging is activated. On any
failure during the protocol or if one of the OriginalityKey were targeted, the PICC ends up
in not authenticated state.
If there is a mismatch between the capabilities expected by the PCD and the capabilities
presented by the PICC to the PCD (both the PDcap2 and the echoed/adjusted
PCDcap2), it is the responsibility of the PCD to take the proper actions based on the
application the PCD is running. This decision is outside the scope of this specification.
9.1.6
AuthenticateEV2NonFirst Command
This section defines the Non-First Authentication, which is recommended to be used if
Secure Messaging is already active, see Table 18. In this procedure both, the PICC as
well as the PCD show in an encrypted way that they possess the same secret, i.e. the
same key. This authentication is supported with AES keys.
The authentication consists of two parts: AuthenticateEV2NonFirst - Part1 and
AuthenticateEV2NonFirst - Part2. Detailed command definition can be found in
Section 10.4.2. This command is rejected if there is no active authentication, except if the

targeted key is the OriginalityKey. For the rest, the behavior is exactly the same as for
AuthenticateEV2First, except for the following differences:
• No PCDcap2 and PDcap2 are exchanged and validated.
• Transaction Identifier TI is not reset and not exchanged.
• Command Counter CmdCtr is not reset.
After successful authentication, the PICC remains in EV2 authenticated state. On any
failure during the protocol, the PICC ends up in not authenticated state.
9.1.7
Session Key Generation
At the end of a valid authentication with AuthenticateEV2First or
AuthenticateEV2NonFirst, both the PICC and the PCD generate two session keys for
secure messaging, as shown in Figure 6:
• SesAuthMACKey for MACing of messages
• SesAuthENCKey for encryption and decryption of messages
Note that these identifiers are also used in context of the LRP protocol, though the actual
calculation of the session keys is different, see Section 9.2.7.

authentications are restricted to target AES keys, the generated session keys are also of
AES.
The input data is constructed using the following fields as defined by [8]. Note that NIST
SP 800-108 allows defining a different order than proposed by the standard as long as it
is unambiguously defined.

Then, the 16-byte session keys are constructed as follows:

• Command header - CmdHeader (if present)
• Command data - CmdData (if present)
For responses, the MAC is calculated over the following data in this order:
• Return code - RC
• Command Counter - CmdCtr (The already increased value)
• Transaction Identifier - TI
• Response data - RespData (if present)
CmdCtr is the Command Counter as defined in Section 9.1.2. Note that the CmdCtr is
increased between the computation of the MAC on the command and the MAC on the
response. TI is the Transaction Identifier, as defined in Section 9.1.1. The other input
parameters are as defined in Section 8.3. The calculation is illustrated in Figure 8.
In case of command chaining, the MAC calculation is not interrupted. The MAC is
calculated over the data including the complete data field (i.e. either CmdData or
RespData of all frames) at once. The MAC is always transmitted by appending to the
unpadded plain command. If necessary, an additional frame is sent. If a MAC over the
command is received, the PICC verifies the MAC and rejects commands that do not
contain a valid MAC by returning INTEGRITY_ERROR.
In this case, the ongoing command and transaction are aborted (see also Section 10).
The authentication state is immediately lost and the error return code is sent without a
MAC appended. Note that any other error during the command execution has the same
consequences.

data field (i.e. CmdData or RespData). Note that none of the commands have a data field
in both the command and the response frame.
After the encryption, the command and response frames are handled as with MAC.
This means that additionally a MAC is calculated and appended for transmission using
the current session key SesAuthMACKey. This is exactly done as specified for MAC
in Section 9.1.9, replacing the plain CmdData or RespData by the encrypted field:
E(SesAuthENCKey; CmdData) or E(SesAuthENCKey; RespData). The complete
calculation is illustrated in Figure 9. In case of command chaining, the encryption/
decryption is applied over the complete data field (i.e. of all frames). If necessary, due to
the padding or the MAC added, an additional frame is sent. If encryption of the command
is required, after the MAC verification as described for MAC, the PICC verifies and
removes the padding bytes. Commands without a valid padding are also rejected by
returning INTEGRITY_ERROR.
In this case, the ongoing command and transaction are aborted (see also Section 10).

LRP Secure Messaging
The LRP Secure Messaging is using AES-128 to construct a Leakage Resilient Primitive.
This way, it allows side-channel resistant implementation.
Like the AES secure messaging, this secure messaging mode is managed by commands
with the same command code as AuthenticateEV2First and AuthenticateEV2NonFirst.
To distinguish and ease the descriptions, they are renamed for the LRP case into
AuthenticateLRPFirst and AuthenticateLRPNonFirst. The recommendations of Section 9
on when to use one or the other command also apply for LRP secure messaging.
9.2.1
Transaction identifier
The Transaction Identifier (TI) is treated exactly in the same way by LRP secure
messaging as defined for AES secure messaging, see Section 9.1.1.

9.2.2
Command counter
The Command counter (CmdCtr) is treated exactly in the same way by LRP secure
messaging as defined for AES secure messaging, see Section 9.1.2.
9.2.3
MAC calculation
MACs are computed by using a CMAC construction on top of the LRP primitive. This is
specified in [10]. This document uses the following notation where the right hand refers to
the notation of [10].
MACLRP(key,message) = CMAC_LRP(4,key, Len(message),message)
Note that in the LRP context a key is not purely a single value, but rather consists of
the associated set of plain texts, an updated key and in context of CMAC also the
subkeys K1 and K2. Therefore K1 and K2 are not shown (contrary to [10]) as they can be
calculated inside.
MACtLRP(key, message) denotes the CMAC after truncation to 8 bytes which is identical
to the truncation of the AES secure messaging i.e. the even-numbered bytes are retained
in most-to-least-significant order, see Section 9.1.3.
The initialization vector used for the CMAC computation is the zero byte IV as prescribed
[10].
9.2.4
Encryption
Encryption and decryption are calculated using a Leakage Resilient Indexed CodeBook
(LRICB) construction on top of the LRP primitive: LRICBof [10].
For this purpose an Encryption Counter is maintained: EncCtr is a 32-bit unsigned
integer as Input Vector (IV) for encryption/decryption. The EncCtr is reset to 000000000h
at PCD and PICC when starting an authentication with AuthenticateLRPFirst or
AuthenticateLRPNonFirst targeting LRP. The counter is incremented during each
encryption/decryption of each 16-byte block. i.e. for 64-byte encryption/decryption
the EncCtr is increased by 5 due to 4 blocks of 16-byte of data plus one block of
padding. Note that for AuthenticateLRPFirst the value 00000000h is already used for
the response of part 2, so the actual secure messaging starts from 00000001h. For
AuthenticateLRPNonFirst, secure messaging starts from 00000000h as the counter is not
used during the authentication. EncCtr is further maintained as long as the PICC remains
in LRP authenticated state. Note that for the key stream calculation [10], the counter is
represented MSB first.
Padding is applied according to Padding Method 2 of ISO/IEC 9797-1 [7], i.e. by adding
always 80h followed, if required, by zero bytes until a string with a length of a multiple
of 16 bytes is obtained. Note that if the plain data is a multiple of 16 bytes already, an
additional padding block is added. The only exception is during the authentication itself
(AuthenticateLRPFirst and AuthenticateLRPNonFirst), where no padding is applied at all.
The notation ELRP(key, plaintext) is used to denote the encryption, i.e. LRICBEnc of [10]
and DLRP(key, ciphertext) for the complementary decryption operation. Note that in the
LRP context a key is not purely a single value, but rather consists of the associated set
of plain texts and updated key. Also, as specified in [10], the EncCtr is updated as part of
the operation.
Note that the EncCtr cannot overflow. Due to the supported file sizes, the CmdCtr will
always expire before.

Note that the MSB representation of EncCtr is different from other counter
representations in this specification, but allows saving some AES calculations in the key
stream generation.
9.2.5
AuthenticateLRPFirst command
The AuthenticateLRPFirst command reuses the same command code as
AuthenticateEV2First. The distinction is made via the PCDCap2.1 parameter, as
explained in Section 9.
The AuthenticateLRPFirst command is fully compliant with the mutual three-pass
authentication of ISO/IEC 9798-4 [7].
The authentication consists of two parts: AuthenticateLRPFirst - Part1 and
AuthenticateLRPFirst Part2. Detailed command definition can be found in Section 10.4.3.
The protocol cannot be interrupted by other commands. On any command different from
AuthenticateLRPFirst - Part2 received after the successful execution of the first part, the
PICC aborts the ongoing authentication.
During this authentication phase, the PICC accepts messages from the PCD that are
longer than the lengths derived from this specification as long as LenCap is correct. This
feature is to support the upgradability to following generations of NTAG 424 DNA.
Apart from bit 1 of PCDCap2.1, which need to be set to 1 for AuthenticateLRPFirst
resulting into 020000000000h, the content of PCDCap2 is not interpreted by the PICC.
The PCD rejects answers from the PICC when they don’t have the proper length.
Upon reception of AuthenticateLRPFirst, the PICC validates the targeted key. If the key
does not exist, AuthenticateLRPFirst is rejected. At PICC level, the only available key is
the OriginalityKey.
The PICC generates a random 16-byte challenge RndB and send this in plain to the
PCD. Additionally, the PICC and PCD reset both CmdCtr and EncCtr to zero and
generate a random TI.
Upon reception of the AuthenticateLRPFirst response from the PICC, the PCD also
generates a random 16-byte challenge RndA. Now the PCD calculates the session keys
SesAuthMACKey and SesAuthENCKey, as specified in Section 9.2.7. As explained there
for LRP, a session key consists of a set of plain texts and an updated key.
Then the PCDResponse computes a MAC over the concatenation of RndA with RndB,
applying the SesAuthMACKey with the algorithm defined in Section 9.2.3. Note that
MACs are not truncated during the authentication. Within AuthenticateLRPFirst - Part2,
the concatenation of RndA and this MAC is sent to the PICC.
Upon reception of AuthenticateLRPFirst - Part2, the PICC validates the received
MAC. If not as expected, the command is rejected. Else it encrypts the generated TI
concatenated with 12 bytes of capabilities to the PCD: 6 bytes of PICC capabilities
PDCap2 and 6 bytes of PCD capabilities PCDCap2 that were received on the command
(sent back for verification). Encryption is done according to Section 9.2.4, applying
SesAuthENCKey.
Note that part of PDCap is configurable with SetConfiguration. PCDCap2 is used to refer
both to the value sent from the PCD to the PICC and to the value used in the encrypted
response message from the PICC to the PCD where in this case the PCDCap2 is the
adjusted version of the originally sent PCDCap2: i.e. truncated or padded with zero
bytes to a length of 6 bytes if needed. After that encryption, the PICCResponse will also
compute a MAC over the concatenation of RndB, RndA and the encrypted data.

9.2.6
AuthenticateLRPNonFirst command
This section defines the LRP Non-First Authentication, which is recommended to be used
if LRP Secure Messaging is already active, see Table 18.
The authentication consists of two parts: AuthenticateLRPNonFirst - Part1 and
AuthenticateLRPNonFirst Part2. Detailed command definition can be found in
Section 10.4.4.
This command is rejected if there is no active LRP authentication, except if the targeted
key is the OriginalityKey.
For the rest, the behavior is exactly the same as for AuthenticateLRPFirst, except for the
following differences:
• PCDCap2 and PDCap2 are not exchanged and validated
• TI is not reset and not exchanged
• CmdCtr is not reset
Note that EncCtr is reset to zero also on AuthenticateLRPNonFirst.
After successful authentication, the PICC remains in LRP authenticated state, except if
the OriginalityKey was targeted. In that case, the PICC is in not authenticated state. On
any failure during the protocol, the PICC ends up in not authenticated state.
9.2.7
Session key generation
Next to the algorithms for MAC calculation and encryption, one of the major differences
between the LRP secure messaging and the AES secure messaging is that the
session keys are generated and already applied during the authentication with
AuthenticateLRPFirst or AuthenticateLRPNonFirst.
Also for the LRP protocol, two keys are generated:
• SesAuthMACKey for MACing of messages
• SesAuthENCKey for encryption and decryption of messages
During the authentication, the SesAuthMACKey is used for both AuthenticateLRPFirst
and AuthenticateLRPNonFirst. SesAuthENCKey is only used for AuthenticateLRPFirst.
Being LRP keys, this section shows how both the plain texts and the updated key [10]
related to these session keys are computed. In the remainder of the document, when
the session key is applied in the LRP context the combination of those plain texts and
updated key is meant.
The session key generation is according to NIST SP 800-108 [8] in counter mode.
The Pseudo Random Function PRF(key; message) applied during the key generation
is the CMAC algorithm on top of the LRP primitive. This is specified in [10], see
also Section 9.2.3. The key derivation key is the key Kx that was applied during
authentication. Note that from this key a set of plaintexts and updated key is computed,
so the static key is only used in this derivation. The generated session keys are AES
keys. The input data is constructed using the following fields as defined by [8]. Note that
NIST SP 800-108 allows defining a different order than proposed by the standard as long
as it is unambiguously defined.
• a 2-byte counter, fixed to 0001h as only 128-bit keys are generated

• a 2-byte length, fixed to 0080h as only 128-bit keys are generated
• a 26-byte context, constructed using the two random numbers exchanged, RndA and
RndB
• a 2-byte label: 9669h
Firstly, the 32-byte input session vector SV is derived as follows:
SV = 00h || 01h || 00h || 80h || RndA[15::14] ||
  (RndA[13::8] # RndB[15::10]) || RndB[9::0] || RndA[7::0] || 96h || 69h
with # being the XOR-operator.
Then, the session key material is constructed as follows:
 AuthSPT = generatePlaintexts(4; Kx)
 {AuthUpdateKey} = generateUpdatedKeys(1; Kx)
 SesAuthMasterKey = MACLRP (Kx; SV )
 SesAuthSPT = generatePlaintexts(4; SesAuthMasterKey)
 {SesAuthMACUpdateKey; SesAuthENCUpdateKey} = generateUpdatedKeys(2;
SesAuthMasterKey)
with generatePlaintexts and generateUpdatedKeys the functions from [10]. Note that
the output of generateUpdatedKeys is shown in the order that the keys are generated.
The actual SesAuthMACKey then consists for LRP of the set of plaintexts SesAuthSPT
(consisting of 16 16-byte values) and SesAuthMACUpdateKey. The SesAuthENCKey
consists of the same set of plaintexts SesAuthSPT and SesAuthENCUpdateKey.

Plain communication mode
For CommMode.Plain, command processing in LRP authenticated state is identical to
AES secure messaging in EV2 authenticated state, see Section 9.1.8.
9.2.9
MAC communication mode
For MAC, apart from using the LRP MAC algorithm, as specified in Section 9.2.3, the
command processing in LRP authenticated state is identical to AES secure messaging in
EV2 authenticated state, see Section 9.1.9. The calculation is illustrated in Figure 10.

9.3
Secure Dynamic Messaging
The Secure Dynamic Messaging (SDM) allows for confidential and integrity protected
data exchange, without requiring a preceding authentication. NT4H2421Gx supports
SDM for reading from one of the StandardData files on the PICC. Secure Dynamic
Messaging allows adding security to the data read, while still being able to access it with
standard NDEF readers. The typical use case is an NDEF holding a URI and some meta-
data, where SDM allows this meta-data to be communicated confidentiality and integrity
protected toward a backend server.
When using SDM, residual risks coming with the Secure Dynamic Messaging for
Reading have to be taken into account. As SDM allows free reading of the secured
message, i.e. without any up-front reader authentication, anybody can read out the
message. This means that also a potential attacker is able to read out and store one ore
multiple messages, and play them at a later point in time to the verifier.
If this residual risk is not acceptable for the system’s use case, the legacy mutual
authentication (using challenge response protocol) and subsequent secure messaging
should be applied. This would require using an own application and operating outside a
standard NDEF read operation.
Other risk mitigation may be applied for SDM to limit the residual risk, without completely
removing it:
• Track SDMReadCtr per tag at the verifying side. Reject SDMReadCtr values that have
been seen before or that are played out-of-order. This is a minimum requirement any
verifier should implement.
• Limit the time window of an attacker by requiring tags to be presented regularly (e.g. at
least once a day) in combination with the previous mitigation.

• Read out the SDM-protected file more than once. This does not protect against
attackers that have read out the valid tag also multiple times and play the received
responses in the same sequence.
9.3.1
SDM Read Counter
In order to allow replay detection by the party validating the data read, a read counter is
associated with the file for which Secure Dynamic Messaging is enabled.
SDMReadCtr is a 24-bit unsigned integer. The SDMReadCtr is reset to 000000h when
enabling SDM with ChangeFileSettings. In cryptographic calculations and represented
with binary encoding on the external interface, the SDMReadCtr is represented LSB first.
When represented with ASCII encoding on the contactless interface, it is represented
MSB first. Note that this is in line with the NFC counter representation in [14]
In not Authenticated state, the SDMReadCtr is incremented by 1 before calculating the
response of the first read command, ReadData or ISOReadBinary, if successful. On
subsequent read commands targeting the same file, the SDMReadCtr is not increased,
and the current value is used. As soon as a different command has been received,
the counter is incremented again on a subsequent read command. Also when varying
between ReadData and ISOReadBinary, the counter is incremented on each first
instance of the read command type. Note that the SDMReadCtr is not incremented when
authenticated.
If the SDMReadCtr reaches the SDMReadCtrLimit (see Section 9.3.2) or the value
FFFFFFh (if SDMReadCtrLimit is not enabled) and a first read command arrives at
the PICC, an error is being returned. Command chaining, see Section 8.5, does not
additionally affect the counter increase. The chained command is considered as a single
command.
SDMReadCtr can be retrieved via the mirroring as part of the PICCData, see
Section 9.3.3, or it can be retrieved via GetFileCounters.
9.3.2
SDM Read Counter Limit
In order to allow limiting the number of reads that can be done with a single device
applying Secure Dynamic Messaging, an optional SDM Read Counter Limit can be
configured. There are two main use cases:
• limit the number of usages from the card side. Note that typically this can also be
controlled from the backend verifying the SDM for Read protected message.
• limit the number of traces that can be collected on the symmetric crypto processing.
This way potential side channel attacks can be mitigated, see also the Failed
Authentication Counter feature for the mutual authentication. In this case, it is
recommended to have the configured limit aligned with TotFailCtrLimit.
The number of reads that can be executed for an SDM configured file can be limited by
setting an SDM Read Counter Limit (SDMReadCtrLimit). This is an unsigned integer of 3
bytes, related with SDMReadCtr. On the interface, the SDMReadCtrLimit is represented
LSB first. The SDMReadCtrLimit can be enabled by setting a customized value with
ChangeFileSettings. It can be retrieved with GetFileSettings.
Once the SDMReadCtr equals the SDMReadCtrLimit, no reading of the file with
ReadData or ISOReadBinary in not authenticated state can be executed. Note that
if authenticated, reading is always possible even if SDMReadCtrLimit is reached,
applying the regular secure messaging. If the SDMReadCtrLimit is disabled with
ChangeFileSettings, this is also equivalent to putting it to the maximum value: FFFFFFh.

9.3.3
PICCData
The PICCData holds metadata of the targeted PICC and file, consisting of the UID and/or
the SDMReadCtr. Whether PICCData is transmitted in plain or encrypted depends on the
configuration of the SDMMetaRead access rights on the file, see Section 8.2.3.4. If the
SDMMetaRead access right is configured for free access (Eh), PICCData is plain and is
defined according to Table 20.
ASCII mirroring is reflected by the function EncodeASCII(), which means that each
hexadecimal character of the hexadecimal representation will be ASCII encoded using
capitals. For example, the UID 04E141124C2880h becomes: 30h 34h 45h 31h 34h 31h
31h 32h 34h 43h 32h 38h 38h 30h.

ASCII
EncodeASCII(UID)
UIDLength = 14 (i.e. 2*UIDLen)
ASCII
EncodeASCII(SDMReadCtr)
SDMReadCtrLength = 6 (i.e. 2*3)
Note that the SDMReadCtr, as defined in Section 9.3.1, is represented MSB first for
ASCII case. If the SDMMetaRead access right is configured for an application key,
PICCData will be encrypted as defined in Section 9.3.4. In this case, the input plaintext
for the encryption is always in binary encoding, while the output ciphertext will be ASCII
encoded.
The PICCData is mirrored within the file. This is configured with ChangeFileSettings via
the related offsets.
In case of plain mirroring (i.e. access right SDMMetaRead = Eh):
• UIDOffset configures the UID mirroring position. It is only given if UID mirroring is
enabled.
• SDMReadCtrOffset configures the SDMReadCtr mirroring position. It is only given if
SDMReadCtr mirroring is enabled. Note that it is possible to enable the SDMReadCtr
but without mirroring by putting SDMReadCtrOffset to FFFFFFh. In this case it can be
retrieved with the GetFileCounters command.
If UID and SDMReadCtr are mirrored within the file, they shall not overlap:
• UIDOffset ≥ SDMReadCtrOffset + SDMReadCtrLength OR SDMReadCtrOffset ≥
UIDOffset + UIDLength.
In case of encrypted mirroring (i.e. SDMMetaRead = 0h..4h), PICCDataOffset configures
the PICCData mirroring. The encryption is outlined in Section 9.3.4.
If the PICCData is mirrored within the file, the mirroring shall always be applied in not
authenticated state, independently of whether Secure Dynamic Messaging applies. This
means it will also be applied if reading the file with free access due to Read or ReadWrite
access right. Note that if authenticated, no mirroring is done, i.e. the regular secure
messaging is always applied on the static file data.
With NT4H2421Gx, PICCData is always ASCII encoded.
When both the UID and SDMReadCtr are mirrored, “x” (78h) is used as a separator
character with NTAG2x [14]. This can be achieved by leaving one byte space between
the placeholders defined by UIDOffset and SDMReadCtrOffset, and writing “x” (78h) in
the static file data.

9.3.4
Encryption of PICCData
In case of encrypted PICCData mirroring (both binary and ASCII), PICCDataTag
specifies what metadata is mirrored, together with the length of the UID if mirrored, as
defined in Table 21.

The format of the plain text is: PICCDataTag [ || UID] [|| SDMReadCtr].
To ensure that the encrypted PICCData cannot be abused for tracking purposes, random
padding is added to the actual plain text input.
The random padding is generated for the response of the first read command, ReadData
or ISOReadBinary. On subsequent read commands targeting the same file the same
random padding is reused. This allows for reading the file in chunks, where a chunk
border might even be in the middle of the encrypted PICCData. As soon as a different
command has been received, fresh random padding is generated on a subsequent read
command. Also when varying between ReadData and ISOReadBinary, fresh random
padding is generated.
The key applied for encryption of PICCData is the SDMMetaReadKey as defined by the
SDMMetaRead access right.
9.3.4.1
AES mode encryption
Encryption and decryption of the PICCData are calculated using the underlying block
cipher according to the CBC mode of NIST SP800-38A [5], applying zero byte IV.
Therefore PICCData is defined as follows:
PICCData = E(SDMMetaReadKey; PICCDataTag [ || UID ] [ || SDMReadCtr ] ||
RandomPadding)
with PICCDataTag as defined in Section 9.3.3, and RandomPadding being a random
byte string generated by the PICC to make the input 16 bytes long. Note that because of
the ASCII encoding the required placeholder length doubles.
9.3.4.2
LRP mode encryption
Encryption and decryption of the PICCData are calculated using a leakage resilient
indexed codebook (LRICB) construction on top of the LRP primitive: LRICB of [14].

For this operation, the LRP key material is constructed as follows:
SDMMetaReadSPT = generatePlaintexts(4; SDMMetaReadKey)
{SDMMetaReadUpdateKey} = generateUpdatedKeys(1; SDMMetaReadKey)
As input counter for the CTR construction, the 8-byte random PICCRand, generated by
the PICC, is used. Apart from the counter applied, this is identical to the encryption used
for LRP secure messaging, see Section 9.2.4.
Therefore PICCData is defined as follows:
PICCData = PICCRand || ELRP (SDMMetaReadKey; PICCDataTag [|| UID] [ ||
SDMReadCtr] || RandomPadding)
with PICCDataTag as defined in Section 9.3.3, and PICCRand being an 8-byte long
random byte string generated by the PICC. RandomPadding is applied like for AES
mode.
The required placeholder length in the NDEF message is 48 bytes due to ASCII
encoding.
Note that due to the different sizes of encrypted PICCData with AES mode and LRP
mode, the Secure Dynamic Messaging and mirroring will be disabled when switching
from AES mode to LRP mode with SetConfiguration.
9.3.5
SDMENCFileData
SDM for Reading supports mirroring (part of the) file data encrypted. This part is called
the SDMENCFileData.
If the SDMFileRead access right is configured for an application key, part of the file
data can optionally be encrypted as defined in Section 9.3.6 when being read out in not
authenticated state.
In this case, the input plaintext for the encryption is always in binary encoding, while the
output ciphertext is ASCII encoded.
Note that if authenticated, no Secure Dynamic Messaging is applied, i.e. the regular
secure messaging is always applied on the static file data.
The SDMENCFileData (if any) is always mirrored within the file. This is configured with
ChangeFileSettings, see Section 10.7.1 via SDMENCOffset and SDMENCLength. If the
SDMFileRead access right is disabling Secure Dynamic Messaging for reading (i.e. set to
Fh), SDMENCOffset and SDMENCLength are not present in ChangeFileSettings.
If PICCData is mirrored within the file, SDMENCFileData shall not overlap with it.
Depending on what is exactly mirrored, the following holds:
• SDMENCOffset ≥ PICCDataOffset + PICCDataLength OR PICCDataOffset ≥
SDMENCOffset + SDMENCLength.
• SDMENCOffset ≥ UIDOffset + UIDLength OR UIDOffset ≥ SDMENCOffset +
SDMENCLength.
• SDMENCOffset ≥ SDMReadCtrOffset + SDMReadCtrLength OR SDMReadCtrOffset ≥
SDMENCOffset + SDMENCLength.
It shall be ensured that SDMENCOffset + SDMENCLength is smaller than or equal to the
file size. Note that as the SDMMAC is as well mirrored into the file, additional conditions
apply, see Section 9.3.7. The SDMENCLength shall be a multiple of 32 bytes for the
ASCII encoding. With NT4H2421Gx, only ASCII encoding is supported.

9.3.6
Encryption of SDMENCFileData
The key applied for the encryption is a session key SesSDMFileReadENCKey derived
from the application key defined by the SDMFileRead access right as specified in
Section 9.3.9.
From user point of view, the SDMENCOffset and SDMENCLength define a placeholder
within the file where the plain data is to be stored when writing the file.
For ASCII encoding, only the first half of the placeholder is used for storing the plain data,
the second half is ignored for constructing the returned data when reading with SDM. For
example, if targeting to encrypt 2 AES blocks, i.e. 32 bytes, a placeholder of 64 bytes is
reserved via SDMENCOffset and SDMENCLength. The first 32 bytes hold the plaintext,
and the next 32 bytes are ignored when reading with Secure Dynamic Messaging.
9.3.6.1
AES mode encryption
Encryption and decryption of the SDMENCFileData are calculated using the underlying
block cipher according to the CBC mode of NIST SP800-38A [5]. The following IV is
applied:
IV = E(SesSDMFileReadENCKey; SDMReadCtr||00000000000000000000000000h)
with SDMReadCtr LSB first.
For applying SDM with ASCII encoding, the SDMENCFileData is defined as follows:
SDMENCFileData = E(SesSDMFileReadENCKey; StaticFileData[SDMENCOffset::
SDMENCOffset + SDMENCLength=2 - 1])
with StaticFileData being the current file data as written in the placeholder. The file
configuration ensures via SDMENCLength that the input is a multiple of 16 bytes, so no
padding is applied.
Note that it is possible via the read command parameters to read-only part of the file. If
the SDMENCFileData is partially read as per the issued offset and length, a truncated
part of the ciphertext will be returned. As truncation might happen in the middle of an
AES block, this means subsequent read commands to fetch the remainder of the file
might be required to be able to decrypt.
9.3.6.2
LRP mode encryption
Encryption and decryption of the SDMENCFileData are calculated using a leakage
resilient indexed codebook (LRICB) construction on top of the LRP primitive: LRICB of
[10].
As input counter for the CTR construction, a 6-byte counter is used, consisting of
the concatenation of SDMReadCtr and three zero bytes: SDMReadCtr || 000000h.
SDMReadCtr is LSB first. After concatenation the 6-byte are treated as unsigned integer
for the counting.
Apart from the counter applied, this is identical to the encryption used for LRP secure
messaging, see Section 9.2.4.
If applying SDM with ASCII encoding, the SDMENCFileData is defined as follows:
SDMENCFileData = ELRP (SesSDMFileReadENCKey; StaticFileData[SDMENCOffset ...
SDMENCOffset + SDMENCLength/2 - 1])

with StaticFileData being the file data as it was written in the placeholder. The file
configuration ensures via SDMENCLength that the input is a multiple of 16 bytes. No
padding is applied.
9.3.7
SDMMAC
SDM for Reading supports calculating a MAC over the response data. This message
authentication code is called the SDMMAC.
If SDMFileRead access right is configured for an application key, a MAC will be
calculated as defined in Section 9.3.8 when being read out in no authenticated state.
The SDMMAC is to be mirrored within the file via SDMMACOffset. This is configured with
ChangeFileSettings, see Section 10.7.1.
If SDMMAC is mirrored within the file, it is limited to start only after SDMENCFileData, i.e.
SDMMACOffset ≥ SDMENCOffset + SDMENCLength. The SDMMACInputOffset must
ensure that the complete SDMENCFileData is included in the MAC calculation.
As the mirrored SDMMAC is ASCII encoded, the output size doubles to 16 bytes.
It shall be ensured that SDMMACOffset + SDMMACLength is smaller or equal than the
file size. Note that if authenticated, no Secure Dynamic Messaging is applied and the
placeholder data at SDMMACOffset is not replaced, i.e. the regular secure messaging is
always applied on the static file data.
The SDMMACInputOffset will define from which position in the file the MAC calculation
starts. If SDMMAC is mirrored within the file, SDMMACInputOffset must be smaller than
or equal to SDMMACOffset.
MACing is mandatory if the SDMFileRead access right is configured for an application
key. If the SDMFileRead access right is disabling Secure Dynamic Messaging for
reading (i.e. set to Fh), SDMMACOffset and SDMMACInputOffset are not present in
ChangeFileSettings.
With NT4H2421Gx, only ASCII encoding is supported. SDMMAC is always mirrored
within the file.
9.3.8
MAC Calculation
The key applied for the MAC calculation is a session key SesSDMFileReadMACKey
derived from the application key defined by the SDMFileRead access right, as specified
in Section 9.3.9.
9.3.8.1
AES mode MAC calculation
The 8-byte SDMMAC is calculated using AES according to the CMAC standard
described in NIST Special Publication 800-38B [6] applying the same truncation as the
AES mode secure messaging, see Section 9.1.3.
The SDMMAC is defined as follows:
SDMMAC = MACt (SesSDMFileReadMACKey; DynamicFileData[SDMMACInputOffset ...
SDMMACOffset - 1])
with DynamicFileData being the file data as how it is put on the contactless interface, i.e.
replacing any placeholders by the dynamic data.

The 8-byte SDMMAC is calculated using a CMAC construction on top of the LRP
primitive. This is specified in [10].
It is identical to the MAC calculation of LRP secure messaging, see Section 9.2.3, also
applying the same truncation.
Therefore SDMMAC is defined as follows:
SDMMAC = MACtLRP (SesSDMFileReadMACKey;
DynamicFileData[SDMMACInputOffset ... SDMMACOffset - 1])
with DynamicFileData being the file data as how it is put on the contactless interface, i.e.
replacing any placeholders by the dynamic data.
9.3.9
SDM Session Key Generation
For Secure Dynamic Messaging for reading, the following session keys are calculated:
• SesSDMFileReadMACKey for MACing of file data.
• SesSDMFileReadENCKey for encryption of file data
The session key generation is according to NIST SP 800-108 [8] in counter mode.
The pseudo random function applied during the key generation is the CMAC algorithm
described in NIST Special Publication 800-38B [6]. The key derivation key is the

9.3.9.1
AES mode session key generation for SDM
The input data is constructed using the following fields as defined by [8]. Note that NIST
SP 800-108 allows defining a different order than proposed by the standard as long as it
is unambiguously defined.
• a 2-byte label, distinguishing the purpose of the key: 3CC3h for MACing and C33Ch for
encryption.
• a 2-byte counter, fixed to 0001h as only 128-bit keys are generated.
• a 2-byte length, fixed to 0080h as only 128-bit keys are generated.
• a context, constructed using the UID and/or SDMReadCtr, followed by zero-byte
padding if needed.
Firstly, the input session vectors SV x are derived as follows:
SV1 = C3h || 3Ch || 00h || 01h || 00h || 80h || UID || SDMReadCtr
SV2 = 3Ch || C3h || 00h || 01h || 00h || 80h [ || UID] [ || SDMReadCtr] [ || ZeroPadding]
Whether or not the UID and/or SDMReadCtr are included in session vector SV2,
depends on whether they are mirrored, see Section 9.3.3. Note that in case of encrypting
file data, mirroring of both is mandatory.
Therefore they are always included in SV1.
Padding with zeros is done up to a multiple of 16 bytes. So in case of 7-byte UID and
both elements are mirrored, no padding is added. Then, the 16-byte session keys are
constructed as follows:
SesSDMFileReadENCKey = MAC(SDMFileReadKey; SV1)
SesSDMFileReadMACKey = MAC(SDMFileReadKey; SV2)

9.3.9.2
LRP mode session key generation for SDM
The input data is constructed using the following fields as defined by [8]. Note that NIST
SP 800-108 allows defining a different order than proposed by the standard as long as it
is unambiguously defined.
• a 2-byte counter, fixed to 0001h as only 128-bit keys are generated.
• a 2-byte length, fixed to 0080h as only 128-bit keys are generated.
• a context, constructed using the UID and/or SDMReadCtr, followed by zero-byte
padding if needed.
• a 2-byte label: 1EE1h
Firstly, the input session vector SV is derived as follows:
SV = 00h || 01h || 00h || 80h [ || UID] [ || SDMReadCtr] [ || ZeroPadding] || 1Eh || E1h
Whether or not the UID and/or SDMReadCtr are included in the session vectors,
depends on whether they are mirrored, see Section 9.3.3. Note that in case of encrypting
file data, mirroring of both is mandatory. Padding with zeros is done up to a multiple of
16 bytes. So in case of 7-byte UID and both elements are mirrored, no padding is added.
Then, the session key material is constructed as follows:
SDMFileReadSPT = generatePlaintexts(4; SDMFileReadKey)
{SDMFileReadUpdateKey} = generateUpdatedKeys(1; SDMFileReadKey)
SesSDMFileReadMasterKey = MACLRP (SDMFileReadKey; SV)
SesSDMFileReadSPT = generatePlaintexts(4; SesSDMFileReadMasterKey)
{SesSDMFileReadMACUpdateKey; SesSDMFileReadENCUpdateKey} =
generateUpdatedKeys(2; SesSDMFileReadMasterKey)
with generatePlaintexts and generateUpdatedKeys the functions from [10]. Note that the
output of generateUpdatedKeys is shown in the order that the keys are generated.
The actual SesSDMFileReadMACKey then consists for LRP of the set of
plaintexts SesSDMFileReadSPT (consisting of 16 16-byte values) and
SesSDMFileReadMACUpdateKey. The SesSDMFileReadENCKey consists of the same
set of plaintexts SesSDMFileReadSPT and SesSDMFileReadENCUpdateKey.

Authentication commands
Authentication with the defined key is required to access the protected file according to
access rights. Based on successful authentication session keys are generated, which are
used for secure messaging between the terminal and NT4H2421Gx.
Remark:Default FWI settings for authentication and secure messaging are set according
to GSMA specification v2.0 to the value 7h. This value is stored in the User ATS.
10.4.1
AuthenticateEV2First
This command initiates an authentication based on standard AES. After this
authentication, AES secure messaging is applied. This authentication command is
used to authenticate for the first time in a transaction and can always be used within
a transaction. AuthenticateEV2First starts a transaction with a Transaction Identifier
(TI) and AuthenticateEV2NonFirst continues the transaction with that TI. This 3-pass
challenge-response-based mutual authentication command is completed in two parts:

Memory and configuration commands
10.5.1
SetConfiguration
With the SetConfiguration command, the application attributes can be configured. It
requires an authentication with the AppMasterKey and CommMode.Full.
The command consists of an option byte and a data field with a size depending on the
option. The option byte specifies the nature of the data field content.
In the below table “No change” references are used with configurations that are
persistent. This means that the associated configuration is left as it is already in the card
and its value is not changed.

GetCardUID
GetCardUID command is required to get the 7-byte UID from the card. In case "Random
ID" at activation is configured, encrypted secure messaging is applied for this command
and response. An authentication with any key needs to be performed prior to the
command GetCardUID. This command returns the UID and gives the opportunity to
retrieve the UID, even if the Random ID is used.

WriteData
The WriteData command allows writing data to StandardData Files. NT4H2421Gx
supports tearing protection for data that is sent within one communication frame to the
file. Consequently, when using ISO/IEC 14443-4 chaining to write to a StandardData file,
each frame itself is tearing protected but an interrupted chaining can lead to inconsistent
files. Using single-frame WriteData commands instead of using the chaining can enable
better control of the overall write process.
Depending on the communication mode settings of the Data file, data needs to be sent
with either CommMode.Plain, CommMode.MAC or CommMode.Full. All cryptographic
operations are done in CBC mode. In case of CommMode.MAC or CommMode.Full,
the validity of data is verified by the PICC by checking the MAC. If the verification fails,
the PICC stops further user memory programming and returns an Integrity Error to the
PCD. As a consequence of the Integrity Error, any transaction, which might have begun,
is automatically aborted. This can lead to the same situation as described above for an
interrupted WriteData using chained communication.

Inter-industry standard commands
NT4H2421Gx provides the following ISO/IEC 7816-4 wrapped commands.
10.9.1
ISOSelectFile
This command is implemented in compliance with ISO/IEC 7816-4. It selects either the
PICC level, an application or a file within the application.
If P1 is set to 00h, 01h or 02h, selection is done by a 2-byte ISO file identifier. For PICC
level / MF selection, 3F00h or empty data has to be used. For Deticated application
File (DF) and Elementary File (EF) selection, data holds the 2-byte ISO/IEC 7816-4 file
identifier.
If P1 is set to 04h, selection is done by Deticated File (DF) name which can be up to 16
bytes. The registered ISO DF name is D2760000850100h. When selecting this DF name,
the PICC level (or MF) is selected. For selecting the application immediately, the ISO/IEC
7816-4 DF name D2760000850101h can be used.
P2 indicates whether or not File Control Information (FCI) is to be returned in case of
application selection. NT4H2421Gx does not support FCI and thus never returns any
data, but does support both selection options to achieve broadest compatibility. The
number of bytes requested by Le up to the complete file data will be returned in plain.
There is no specific FCI template format checked, i.e. the data stored in the file will be
sent back as is. In case of PICC level or file selection, FCI data is never returned. For
NT4H2421Gx, no FCI will be returned as the pre-installed application does not contain
such a file.

10.10
Originality check commands
The originality check allows verification of the genuineness of NTAG 424 DNA
(NT4H2421Gx). Two ways are offered to check the originality of the PICC: the first
is based on a symmetric authentication, the second works on the verification of an
asymmetric signature retrieved from the card.
The authentication procedure for AES keys can be used to authenticate to one of the
four OriginalityKey and check whether the PICC is a genuine NXP product. NT4H2421Gx
supports targeting the OriginalityKey with the LRP authentication using AES. For details
on the authentication command, see Section 9.2. The following variants can be used:
• AuthenticateLRPFirst, see Section 9.2.5
• AuthenticateLRPNonFirst, see Section 9.2.6
The asymmetric originality signature is based on ECC and only requires a public key for
the verification, which is done outside the card. The Read_Sig command can be used
in both ISO/IEC 14443-3 and ISO/IEC 14443-4 protocols to retrieve the signature. If
the PICC is not configured for Random ID, the command is freely available. There is no
authentication required. If the PICC is configured for Random ID, an authentication is
required.
10.10.1
Read_Sig
The Read_Sig retrieves the asymmetric originality signature based on an asymmetric
cryptographic algorithm Elliptic Curve Cryptography Digital Signature Algorithm
(ECDSA), see [13] and can be used in both ISO/IEC 14443-3 and ISO/IEC 14443-4
protocol. The purpose of originality check signature is to protect from mass copying of
non NXP originated ICs. The purpose of originality check signature is not to completely
prevent HW copy or emulation of individual ICs.
A public key is required for the verification, which is done outside the card. The
NXPOriginalitySignature is computed over the UID and written during manufacturing.
If the PICC is not configured for Random ID, the command is freely available. There is
no authentication required. If the PICC is configured for Random ID, an authentication
with any authentication key is required. If there is an active authentication, the command
requires encrypted secure messaging.
Remark: The originality function is provided to prove that the IC has been manufactured
by NXP Semiconductors.
